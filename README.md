# 🧁 Kaju Katli Clicker Game 🍬

Welcome to the **Kaju Katli Clicker Game** – a deliciously fun browser game where every click brings you closer to sweet satisfaction! 🍥

This mini-project was created as part of my JavaScript learning journey. It's a simple clicker game designed to help me practice DOM manipulation, event handling using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
